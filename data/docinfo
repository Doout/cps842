  "W": "In the thermal detection of rapid biochemical\nreactions it is necessary to correct the temperature \ndata for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical\ncalorimeter.  To handle the complexities arising \nfrom varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating\nlayers, a computer program was developed \nwhich gives the temperature distribution of the system\nas a function of radius and time.  This distribution \nis corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates\nthe instantaneous chemical state of there \naction, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.\n The program is based on a direct statement of \nFourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate\nequation to provide a \"bookkeeping law\" to follow \nthe reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a\nway that the computer continually stores the heat \ndistribution.  A computer analysis method is here regarded\nas one in which the physical laws of a process \nare used explicitly in the program. Usually this results\nin by passing much of the mathematical procedures \nconventionally used.  The program was tested against\nsome known exact solutions of the heat equation \nand gave identical results, and compared well with experimental\ndata of a known biochemical reaction. \n The construction of computer programs based on the direct\nstatement of the physical laws is a principle \nof general applicability which has been applied\nto several other physical phenomena."

At present, shooting techniques are the\neasiest method of attacking these problems.  When \nthese fail, the more difficult method of finite differences\ncan often be used to obtain a solution.  \nThis paper gives examples and discusses the finite difference\nmethod for non-linear two-point boundary-value \nproblems."

Following a brief description \nof standard list structures with single-word items, the\nmultiword items are introduced.  Then variable-length \nitems are described, along with the corresponding space-utilization\nproblems.  Finally, several examples \nare given to illustrate the use of multiword lists. This\npaper attempts to draw together various recent \npapers which have applied some of these concepts in different\nways, and indicate how they relate to the \nmore general problems."

Furthermore,local changes of \na process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output\nfiles involved) can be effected by local modifications \nin the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the\ntables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive \npreparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the\nsource programs into efficient machine codes. \n The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical\nlanguage design philosophies.  It stresses \nthe structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented\nin the languages, as opposed to emphasizing \nformal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.\n It relies exclusively on nonprocedural \nrepresentation of process as sets (tables) of relations\nbetween data and results (there are no control \nstatements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure\ndescriptions (which are one-to-one translations \nof flowcharts).

  "W": "A number of diverse recognition procedures\nthat have been proposed for parsing sentences with \nrespect to a context-free grammar are described in this\npaper by means of a common device.  Each procedure \nis defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministic\nTuring Machine recognizer that is \nequivalent to a given context-free grammar.  The formalization\nof the Turing Machine has been chosen \nto make possible particularly simple description of\nthe parsing procedures considered.  An attempt has \nbeen made to compare recognition efficiencies for the\nprocedures defined.  For a few simple grammars \nand sentences a formal comparison has been made.  Empirical\ncomparison of the recognition of more realistic \nprogramming languages such as LISP and ALGOL has been\nmade by means of a program which simulates the \nTuring Machine on the Univac M-460 computer.  Several\nalgorithms for producing grammars equivalent to \na given context-free grammar have been considered, and\nthe increase in recognition efficiency they afford \nhas been empirically investigated."

Many of ALGOL \n60's features emerge as particular arrangements of\na small number of structural rules, suggesting new \nclassifications and generalizations.  The correspondence\nis first described informally, mainly by illustrations. \n The second part of the paper gives a formal description,\ni.e. an \"abstract compiler\" into the \"abstract \nobjct language.\"  This is itself presented in a \"purely\nfunctional\" notation, that is one using only \napplication and abstraction."

Part III presents a detailed comparison\nof six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, \nCLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of\neach are summarized in a series of tables.  The \nimplications of this analysis for designers of languages,\nfor users, and for implementers are developed. \n The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now\navailable for computer simulation offer features \nwhich none of the more general-purpose packages do and\nthat analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each \nsuggests ways in which both current and future simulation\nlanguages and packages can be improved."

The difficulty\nlies in whether to attach the else to the first if \nor to the second one.  Existing solutions to the problem\nare either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. \n Let Sand S1 be statements.  We define S to be closed\nif \"S else S1\" is not a statement, and to be open \nif \"S else S1\" is a statement.  Thus an unconditional\nstatement is  a closed statement.  Open and closed \nconditional statements are defined by syntax equations\nin such a way as to preserve openness and closure. \n In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed\nstatement.  It is shown that the syntax equations \nare unambiguous, and that may change in the statement\ntypes required within the syntax equations would \nlead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction."

Several alternative\nforms of each of these components are described, \ncompared and evaluated.  Many examples, frequently from\nlist processing languages, illustrate the forms \ndescribed.  Elementary program statements usually take\nthe form of commands, requirements, or implicit \nspecifications.  A command is an imperative statement\nthat commands the action to be taken.  A requirement \ndescribes the effect to be achieved without saying anything\nabout the actions to be taken.  An implicit \nspecification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer\nmust understand what actions will be taken \nto achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered\nexplicitly, by execute call, or by function \ncomposition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally\nrequire special linkage conventions.  An execute \nsubroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from\na basic instruction of the programming language. \n Function composition is a convenient alternative to\nthe explicit call.

If,\nhowever, the normalization is to be eliminated one \nhas to choose proper higher precision segments of operands\nfor the basic division.

This system\naccepts as input description of the multicharacter \nitems or of words allowable in a language given in terms\nof a subset of regular expressions. The output \nof the system is a lexical processor which reads a string\nof characters and combines them into the items \nas defined by the regular expressions.  Each output\nitem is identified by a code number together with \na pointer to a block of storage containing the characters\nand character count in the item.  The processors \nproduced by the system are based on finite-state machines.\n Each state of a \"machine\" corresponds to \na unique condition in the lexical processing of a character\nstring.  At each state a character is read, \nand the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition\nappropriate actions are taken based on the \nparticular character read.  The system has been in operation\nsince 1966, and processors generated have \ncompared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs\nto accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors \nfor AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been\nproduced.  The techniques employed are independent \nof the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the\nword \"events\" is substituted for character string, \nthese processors may be described as generalized decision-making\nmechanisms based upon an ordered sequence \nof events.  This allows the system to be used in a\nrange of applications outside the area of lexical \nprocessing.  However convenient these advantages may\nbe, speed is the most important consideration.  \nIn designing a system for automatic generation of a\nlexical processor, the goal was a processor which \ncompletely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly\nas fast as hand-coded processors, which would \nanalyze the language and detect errors, and\nwhich would be convenient and easy to use."

The use of these circuits, which\nin this paper are termed column value indicators, \nreduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary\nto retrieve in order a number of distinct \nwords from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout\nby the described method of m distinct binary \nwords, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.

In the cases where the\nS(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the \nwhole program must be generally taken into account;\ntherefore it is very difficult for the programmer \nand/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of\nthe S(ij).  It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but \nthe quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where\nC(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each \ni.  Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to\nS(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because \nwe must estimate only the \"probabilities\" of events\nwhere instruction i is executed after instruction \nI(i).  This estimation can often be done without considering\nthe structure of the whole program.  In \nthe first part of the paper, using the theory of the\nMarkov chains, an algorithm for the computation \nof the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways\nof obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given.

Parallel-processor \nsystems are multiprocessor systems in which several of\nthe processors can simultaneously execute separate \ntasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease\nthe solution time of a computational problem. The \nprocessors have independent instruction counters, meaning\nthat each processor executes its own task program \nrelatively independently of the other processors.  Communication\nbetween cooperating processors is by \nmeans of data in storage shared by all processors.  A\nprogram for the determination of the distribution \nof current in an electrical network was written for a\nparallel-processor computing system, and execution \nof this program was simulated.  The data gathered from\nsimulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution \nof this problem, typical of a large class of important\nproblems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, \nsolution time when N processors are applied approaches\n1/N times the solution time for a single processor, \nwhile improper programming can actually lead to an increase\nof solution time with the number of processors. \n Stability of the method of solution was also investigated."

  "W": "The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is\na program designed to be capable of being taught \nto \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program\nhas not seen before is input to it, it comprehends \nthat text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit)\nassertion of the new text to a large memory. \n This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual\nassertions about the world.  The program also \ncreates copies of the parts of its memory which have\nbeen found to relate to the new text, adapting and \ncombining these copies to represent the meaning of the\nnew text.  By this means, the meaning of all text \nthe program successfully comprehends is encoded into\nthe same format as that of the memory.  In this \nform it can be added into the memory.  Both factual\nassertions for the memory and the capabilities for \ncorrectly relating text to the memory's prior content\nare to be taught to the program as they are needed. \n TLC presently contains a relatively small number of\nexamples of such assertions and capabilities, but \nwithin the system, notations for expressing either of these\nare provided.  Thus the program now corresponds \nto a general process for comprehending language, and\nit provides a methodology for adding the additional \ninformation this process requires to actually comprehend\ntext of any particular kind.  The memory structure \nand comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions\nand capabilities for relating text to such \nstored assertions to generalize automatically.  That\nis, once such an assertion or capability is put \ninto the system, it becomes available to help comprehend\na great many other sentences in the future. \n Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or\nlinguistic capability will often provide a large \nincrement in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and\nin its overall ability to comprehend text.  The \nprogram's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension."

Such a structure provides a compromise \nbetween the fast search/slow update characteristics of\nbinary searching and the slow search/fast update \ncharacteristics of serial searching.  His method, however,\ncontains the limiting restriction that all \nterminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.  This paper\nconsiders the effect of relaxing this restriction. \n First, trees which have the property that a priori the\nfilial set of each node is well defined are studied. \n It is proved that coding the nodes within each filial\nset with respect to the number of terminal nodes \nreachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee\nminimum average search time.  Then the more \ngeneral case (that is, where the entire structure of\nthe tree is changeable) is treated.  A procedure \nis developed for constructing a tree with a minimum\naverage search time.  A simple closed expression \nfor this minimum average search time is obtained as\na function of the number of terminal nodes.  The \nstorage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained\ntree structure on a digital computer is also \ndetermined.  Finally, the total cost of the structure,\nusing Sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed. \n It is shown that significant improvements in both\nthe average search time and the total cost can be \nobtained by relaxing Sussenguth's restriction that all\nterminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree."

Determining \nthe best algorithm for computer implementation depends\nupon the extent to which extraneous factors are \nintroduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by\ntruncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, \nand computing speed.  Preliminary considerations narrow\nthe choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's \ndeterminant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence\n(p.r.s.) algorithm.  Detailed tests performed \non sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant\nis superior in all respects except for \nunivariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced\np.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.

The analysis is\nparameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes\nto fill available core with records, and the file size in units\nof core lengths; and thus it can be applied to any conventional\nCPU/mass storage combination.  An explicit formula for total read\ntime is derived, in terms of the parameters, which correlates very\nwell with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge\norders yielded by the algorithm.  The formula involves the roots of a simple \ntranscendental equation.  A short table of these roots\nis included.  Numerical results are graphically displayed for a wide\nrange of the parameters.

This generalization turns out to\nbe easy to implement in a computer program.  A numerical approximation\nshows that a = 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with\n1.386 for the original.  This implies a decrease in number of comparisons of \n18 percent; actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time."

The elements \ncommon to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these \nelements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated.\nThese modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis\nsystems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any\ncomplexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The\nbasic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given\nof its current utility software, consisting of \"macros\" to produce\nself-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,\nmap coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate\nd in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,\nand it should be fully integrable with user's program written\nin most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,\nlocating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of\naxes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically\nby the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring \nof plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.\nTransformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or \nsubplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user \nmay interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct \nhis own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and\nto produce a variety of artistic and other effects."

Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at \ntimes, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted \nflexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources.  Consideration is \nalso given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful \neffects of frequent price fluctuations.

Two new hash-coding methods are examined\nand compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.\nThe computational factors considered are the size of the hash area\n(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the \ngiven set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  The new methods \nare intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded \ninformation from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in \nspace is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of \nerrors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, \napplications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident\nhash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such \napplications, it is envisaged that overall performance\ncould be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in\nconjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some\nsecondary and perhaps time-consuming test to \"catch\" the small\nfraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed\nwhich illustrates possible areas of application for the new\nmethods.

Change in data representation will often be needed as a result \nof changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the \ntypes of stored information.  Existing noninferential, formatted data systems \nprovide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network \nmodels of the data.  In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.\nA model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations,\nand the concept of a universal form for data base relations,\nand the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.  In\nSection 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical\ninference) are discussed and applied to the problems\nof redundancy and consistency in the user's model."

The functional approach to data structures and the\nuse of references insure that any process which accepts some data\nstructure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless\nof its internal representation.  More generally, any data structure\nmay be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary\nalgorithm for computing or accessing its components.

An M \u0026 N procedure was\nwritten in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that \nthe M \u0026 N procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max\nprocedure.

In all, qN+n-1 \nt-digit floating-point additions are performed.  Under\nusual conditions, the relative error in the computed \nsum is at most [(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) for some v.  Further,\nwith an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions, the \ncomputed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy.\n For example, for the IBM/360 (B=16, t=14, M=63, \nm=64), typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32. \nIn this case, (*) becomes N \u003c= 32,768, and we have \n[(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) = 4x16^-13."

It is suggested that there \nis some similarity between the idea of a file directory\nand a storable object of type context.  Manipulations \nwith contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted\nthat there is a simple extension of Church's \nLambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of\ncontext manipulation.  Whereas a function can be \nregarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of\nthe expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), \nit is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction\nbased upon the first two terms in the equivalent \nexpression Mu(name list)(value list)(expression)."

A scheduling and swapping \nalgorithm which keeps the resource count of each process\nabove its policy function will provide the specified \nlevel of service.

Generations of\ncryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus \nfar without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies\nof fortune hunters and treasure seekers have \ndevoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills\nof Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. \n The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,\nyet serious students of cryptography have always \nhad nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.\n It has been alleged that the \"known solution\" to \nCypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...(\"I\nhave deposited in the County of Bedford about \nfour miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault...\")\nwith the aid of an unsanitized version of the \nDeclaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative,\nand grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago \nfor whatever reasons.  Modern computer technology could\nobviously perform signature analyses the process \nof encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper\ninsights into their construction.  For the benefit \nof the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the\nsecond cypher employs a specified document whose \nwords are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters\nof these words are sought out at random to \nmatch the letters of these words are sought out at random\nto match the letters of the clear text or message. \n The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches\nis then written down as the final code.  While \nprimitive, the process has the advantage of relative\nsecurity until the source document becomes known; \nat that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second\ngraders.  The work now completed with the help \nof our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies\nof the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. \n For example, we have turned the entire process of\nsimulated encoding by various schemes over to the \nmachine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic\ncodes; we have also encoded various messages by \nhand, using different texts and a variety of methods to\nobtain their signatures. These simulations provide \nconvincing evidence that the signatures are both process\nand data dependent; they indicate also very \nstrongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that\nit is merely a matter of time before someone \nfinds the correct source document and locates the\nright vault in the common-wealth of Virginia."

  "W": "Most current programming languages treat computation\nover different classes of objects (e.g. \nnumbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct\ncompilation and execution, the following question \nthen arises: is a program properly constructed so that\nits operations and operands are compatible?  The \nactivity of answering this question is usually called\ntype checking.  This paper attempts to isolate \nthe notion of type checking and presents a partial\nsolution to the type checking problem based on the \nnotions of abstraction and application of functions. \nIn particular, a program is mapped into an expression \nwithin a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which\ncharacterizes the type relations within the program \nand eliminates all other information.  The determination\nof the type-wise correctness or incorrectness \nof the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding\nLambda calculus expression to one of two normal \nforms, the constant \"correct\" for a type-wise correct\nprogram or the constant \"error\".  An application \nto type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant\nproblems faced for any notion of type checking \nare discussed."

The chief computational advantage \noffered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed\nachieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel \nprocessing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular\narrays are inherently well suited for the solution \nof many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency\nmatrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; \neach matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,\nand typical row and column operations are readily \nimplemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge\nin the effective use of cellular arrays for the \nsolution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms\nthat exploit the possibilities for parallelism, \nespecially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently\nserial.  In particular, several parallelized \nalgorithms are presented for the solution of certain\nspanning tree, distance, and path problems, with \ndirect applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,\nand the analysis of many types of networks. \n These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in\nmany cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, \nwhere n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward\ncellular implementations of the well-known \nserial algorithms for these problems require about n\nsteps, and noncellular implementations require from \nn^2 to n^3 steps."

Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing\nseveral users to share data via input and output \nof information stored in files kept in secondary storage.\n Through the use of segmentation, however, \nMultics provides direct hardware addressing by user and\nsystem programs of all information, independent \nof its physical storage location.  Information is stored\nin segments each of which is potentially sharable \nand carries its own independent attributes of size and access\nprivilege.  Here, the design and implementation \nconsiderations of segmentation and sharing in Multics\nare first discussed under the assumption that all \ninformation resides in large, segmented main memory. \nSince the size of main memory on contemporary systems \nis rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics\nsoftware achieves the effect of a large segmented \nmain memory through the use of the Honeywell\n645 segmentation and paging hardware."

The method is to use hashing\ntechniques to allocate space for such records. \n If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior\nto the conventional ISAM method of chaining the \noverflow records via linked list techniques.  These conditions are:\nlong overflow chains with significant \noverflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record\nkeys which are small compared to the total record \nsize; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed\nto the sequential mode.  Using hashed overflow, \nthe time to locate a record is dependent not on the total\nvolume of overflow records as in conventional \nISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records."

On the other \nhand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because\nthey require multiple passes through the XY \ndisplay file.  The scan conversion algorithm described\nhere uses a linked list data structure to process \nthe lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to\ngroups of scan lines.  A relatively small primary \nmemory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image\nfor a group of scan lines.  When this portion \nof the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for\nthe next portion.  Because of the list processing \nprocedures used, only a single pass through the XY display\nfile is required when generating the binary \nimage and only a slight increase in execution time over\nthe fully buffered core results.

This paper\nposes an optimization problem in the design of \nsuch trees to serve a well-specified application. The\nproblem is academic in the sense that ordinarily \nthe optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical\ntechniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially \nuseful for the comparison it affords between observed\nperformance and that of an intuitively attractive \nideal search procedure.  As a practical application\nof such a model this paper considers the design of \na novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation\nof data and shows that essentially the \nsame algorithm can be used to design either an ideal\nsearch tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental \nstudy of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts."

The read-interlock method does\nrequire a special\"read-interlock\" instruction \nin the repertoire of the processors and a special \"read-interlock\"\ncycle in the repertoire of the memory \nmodules.  When a processor examines a \"lock\" (a memory\nlocation) with a read-interlock instruction, it \nwill be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining\na lock immediately sets it if it was not already \nset (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). \nWriting into a lock clears it.  Having the processor \ninterrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of\nbranching is advantageous if the branch would have \nresulted in an effective interrupt."

  "W": "Although sometimes thought of as only a component\nof time-sharing operation, multiprogramming \ncan involve broader questions of resource allocation,\nsince fairness is not required to meet a response \ncriterion.  In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve\nmaximal resource use to be unfair, for example \nby holding an input/output channel idle for a program\nwhile it completes a small amount of processor \nusage, enabling further use of the channel.  Several\napplications of this principle are given, and it \nis suggested that a multiprogramming executive might\ndynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to \ngain efficiency.  Allocation of resources is closely connected\nto accounting for those resources, raising \nthe problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead,\nand relative weighting of charges for dependent \nresources.  Since weightings may depend on allocation\nalgorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting \nparameters.  Often the only repeatable accounting is\none which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, \nand should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges\nwill result.  Multiprogramming turns on allocation \nof the memory resource essential to control of other\nresources.  The general suggestions for allocation \nand accounting are applied to this question, and some\ndetails provided for the case of a monitor which \ncontrols a virtual-memory machine."

In two dimensions the algorithms\npermit clipping against irregular convex windows. \n Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered\nsequence of vertices without repetition of first \nand last, in marked contrast to representation as a\ncollection of edges as was heretofore the common \nprocedure.  Output polygons have an identical format,\nwith new vertices introduced in sequence to describe \nany newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle\nthe particularly difficult problem of detecting \nthat a new vertex may be required at a corner of the\nclipping window.  The algorithms described achieve \nconsiderable simplicity by clipping separately against\neach clipping plane or window boundary.  Code \ncapable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary\nis reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. \n Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only\ntwo vertex values and may begin its processing \nas soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding\nstage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered \nfor clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping\nagainst very complex window shapes is practical. \n For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane\ntruncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping \nvolume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection\nscreen serve to limit the range of depth \npreserved through the projection.  A perspective projection\nmethod which provides for arbitrary view \nangles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping\nplanes is described.

The\ntime-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and \nbest-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each\nother.  Except for small populations, the size \nof the request population had little effect on allocation\nefficiency.  For exponential and hyperexponential \ndistributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit;\nbut for normal and uniform distributions, \nand for exponential distributions distorted in various\nways, best-fit outperformed first-fit.  It is \nhypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit,\nit does so because first-fit, by preferentially \nallocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks\nto grow at the other end.  Sufficient contiguous \nspace is thereby more likely to be available for relatively\nlarge requests.  Results of simulation experiments \nsupported this hypothesis and showed that the relative\nperformance of first-fit and best-fit depends \non the frequency of request.  When the coefficient of\nvariation of the request distribution is greater \nthan or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit."

It has the same underlying\nm-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is \na parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the\nnodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold \na key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are\nonly one bit long.  In the analysis part of the \npaper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the\nretrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections \nof one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage\nrequirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This \nimprovement in storage requirements and retrieval time\nis achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility \nof the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.\n First the C-trie is analyzed as a data \nstructure, and then several methods of its use\nfor relatively static databases are discussed."

A new derivation is given, and it\nis shown that previous derivations make an assumption \nthat may be violated frequently.  On the basis of the simulation\ndata and the derivation, it is hypothesized \nthat the anomalous behavior results from the combined\neffects of systematic placement and the statistics \nof the release process.  Additional simulations support\nthis hypothesis.  Systematic placement, which \nrefers to the natural convention of always allocating\nstorage requests against the same end of the free \nblock selected by the allocation strategy, tends to\norder blocks within contiguous groups according to \ntheir allocation time.  The degree of anomalous behavior\ndepends on the extent to which allocated blocks \nare released in the order of their allocation.  For\nnon-Markovian release processes, the extent of the \ncorrelation between allocation order and release order\nvaries approximately inversely with the coefficient \nof variation of the memory residence time distribution.\n The simulations show that allocation efficiency \ndepends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency\ndecreases as the distribution's coefficient \nof variation increases.

Programming languages offer \nan obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization\nis well advanced; however, the semantical theory \ncan hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have\nmany examples, we have still to give wide-ranging \nmathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?\n What is a computable process?  How (or how \nwell) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally\nenter in giving descriptions of processes. \n The definition of the precise meaning of a program\nthen requires us to explain what are the objects \nof computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)\nand how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). \n So far the theories of automata and of nets, though\nmost in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only \na portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too\nmuch concentration on the finite-state and algebraic \naspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level\nprogram features involves us with infinite \nobjects and forces us to pass through several levels\nof explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to \nthe final simulation on a real machine.  These levels\ncan be made mathematically exact if we can find \nthe right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.\n The experience of many independent workers \nwith the method of data types as lattices (or partial\norderings) under an information content ordering, \nand with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the\nflexibility of this approach in providing definitions \nand proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence\non implementations.

  "W": "The performance of information retrieval systems\ncan be evaluated in a number of different \nways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based\non measuring the retrieval performance of an average \nuser query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult\nto construct for the average case.  In the present \nstudy, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the\nperformance of a specific user query.  The concept \nof query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability\nof occurrence of a query term in the documents \nrelevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy\nto the frequency of occurrence of the term in the \ndocuments of a collection it is possible to give formal\nproofs of the effectiveness with respect to a \ngiven user query of a number of automatic indexing systems\nthat have been used successfully in experimental \nsituations.  Among these are inverse document frequency\nweighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase \ngeneration."

Compatible with the ANSI \n1966 Fortran Standard and with many commonly supported\nFortran extensions, CFT does not require any source \nprogram modifications or the use of additional nonstandard\nFortran statements to achieve vectorization. \n Thus the user's investment of hundreds of man months\nof effort to develop Fortran programs for other \ncontemporary computers is protected."

In this paper we suggest a heuristically \nguided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic\nprogramming, recognizes identical subproblems but \nwhich can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal\nsolutions.

The objective\nis to find a transformed digital picture of \na given picture such that the sum of absolute errors\nbetween the gray level his togram of the transformed \npicture and that of a reference picture is minimized.\n This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered \nobjects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly ordered\nboxes of assorted sizes, such that the \naccumulated error of space under packed or overpacked\nin the boxes is minimized; the placement function \nis monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution\nto this problem.  A tree search algorithm for \noptimal his togram matching is presented which has time\ncomplexity O(k1 x k2).  If the monotone property \nis dropped, then the problem becomes NP-complete,\neven if it is restricted to k2 = 2."

An \nalternative functional style of programming is founded\non the use of combining forms for creating programs. \n Functional programs deal with structured data, are often\nnonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically \nconstructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require\nthe complex machinery of procedure declarations \nto become generally applicable.  Combining forms can\nuse high level programs to build still higher level\nones in a style not possible in conventional languages.\n Associated with the functional style of programming \nis an algebra of programs whose variables range over\nprograms and whose operations are combining forms. \n This algebra can be used to transform programs and\nto solve equations whose \"unknowns\" are programs \nin much the same way one transforms equations in high\nschool algebra.  These transformations are given \nby algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language\nin which programs are written.  Combining \nforms are chosen not only for their programming power\nbut also for the power of their associated algebraic \nlaws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed\nbehavior and termination conditions for large \nclasses of programs.  A new class of computing systems\nuses the functional programming style both in \nits programming language and in its state transition\nrules.

Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical\ninformation or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.\nTesting this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly\nlinear with the size of the program, and that it leads\nto a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time."

Direct control of ordering seems to simplify\ncorrectness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed\nsystems.  The mechanism is defined formally, and then several\nexamples of its use are given.  The relationship of the mechanism\nto protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,\neventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement\nof information matters.

  "W": "An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced\n(OSHB) binary search tree is presented.  The algorithm operates in time \nO(log n), where n is the number of nodes in\nthe tree.  This represents an improvement over the best previous\nly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require\ntime O(log 2n).  Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier \nresults have shown that deletion in such a structure can\nalso be performed in O(log n) time.  Thus the result of this paper\ngives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should\nbe the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time \ncomplexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded\nthat insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can\nbe performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for\nthe more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However,\nthe insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much\nmore complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees."

The Q-32\ncomputer as System Development Corporation, Santa Monica, California, was \nchosen because it also had a LISP 1.5 compiler. Programming and debugging was\ndone from a remote teletype console at Stanford University."

The \"metalinguistic formulae\"\nadmirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying \na language, but they are certainly not very readable\nfor a beginner.  However, experience has shown that \nonce the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn\nALGOL and to write algorithms in it.  The language \nis so general and powerful it can handle an enormous\nclass of problems.  It is not hard to learn those \nparts of ALGOL present in other compiler languages: how\nto write assignment and go to and for statements, \netc.  Indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictions\nimposed by other compiling languages have finally \nbeen lifted.  But ALGOL also allows many unobvious things\nto be written, as we will see later, and herein \nlies a problem: ALGOL seems to have become too general.\n So many restrictions have been lifted that a \nlot of technical details crop up which are hard to learn\nand to use correctly.  In this paper some of \nthe more obscure features of the language are considered\nand their usefulness is discussed.  Remarks \nare based on the authors' interpretations of the ALGOL 60 Report."

  "W": "The binary number system offers many advantages\nover a decimal representation for a high-performance, \ngeneral-purpose computer.  The greater simplicity of\na binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness \nof binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic\nspeed.  Less obvious and perhaps more important \nis the way binary addressing and instruction formats can\nincrease the overall performance.  Binary addresses \nare also essential to certain powerful operations which\nare not practical with decimal instruction formats. \n On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for\ncommunicating between man and the computer.  In \napplications requiring the processing of a large volume\nof inherently decimal input and output data, \nthe time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely\nbinary computer may be significant.  A slower \ndecimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder\ndoing an addition and two conversions.  A careful \nreview of the significance of decimal and binary addressing\nand both binary and decimal data arithmetic, \nsupplemented by efficient conversion instructions."

In this paper, the computational \nprocedure is considered more fully, and the similarities\nto some of Stone's equations are indicated. \n It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving\nno minimization may be found.  In addition, \nit is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the\ncurve-fitting problem when the additional constraints \nare added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve."

The technique is quite simple and produces\nstrict-sense stationary noise which agrees \napproximately with R(t), the prescribed auto-covariance\nfunction (acf), over an interval [-T(0), T(0)]. \n The method consists of approximating the spectral density\nby a periodic process with spectral lines, \nand then synthesizing the periodic noise with random\nphases and appropriate amplitudes.  In order to \nsimplify discussion of the statistical properties of the\nnoise generated, the technique is first presented \nin terms of exact harmonic analysis.

The legal ramifications\ninvolve not only the mechanization itself, but \nalso the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon\nof off premises processing.  It is essential \nto identify and provide for many legal aspects right\nnow, before systems and practices crystallize, in \norder to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical\ncomplications and expense.  The legal aspects \nof computerization in the banking business are especially\ndiverse.  In some states, there might be the \nbasic question whether banks are authorized by law to\ninvest in the new facilities, either directly or \nthrough cooperatives.  More challenging are questions\nrelating to off-premises processors, particularly \nwith respect to the obligation not to disclose information\nconcerning a bank's customers, the adequacy \nof fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for\nimproper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility \nto regulation by government agencies.  Also pertinent\nis the propriety of data processing by banks for \nnonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of\nthat service without charge for bank depositors."

The codes, although constructed \nas part of a computerized hospital simulation, have been\nable to handle the results of every laboratory \ntest that they have encountered.  The unique feature of\nthese codes is that they can accept conventionally \nrecorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results.\n Consequently, clinical test results need \nnot be arbitrarily stratified, standardized, or altered\nin any way to be coded.  This paper describes \nhow the codes were developed and presents a listing of the\nurin analysis codes.  Five criteria used in developing \nthe codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous\nterminology is discussed.  A solution to \nthe problem is described.  Flexible, computer-produced,\ncomposite laboratory reports are also discussed, \nalong with reproduction of such a report.

Physical characteristics of the \ntwo-disk system (4,194,304 72-bit words, 8 usec-per-word\ntransmission rate, etc.) are noted.  Timing \nlimitations due to arm motion and disk rotation are discussed.\n Applications of disk usage are discussed \nseparately for problem programs and for systems programs\nsuch as compilers and the supervisory program. \nApproximately 260,000 words of disk storage are reserved\nfor the storage of systems programs and the \nsubroutine library.  Problem programs, however, are not\ncurrently filed on the disk.  Certain programming \ntechniques are discussed for transmitting words between\ndisk and core storage with minimum delaying and \ninterruption of the arithmetic unit.  Dumps on disk are\nconsidered for both recovery from computer malfunction \nand for mathematical or physical developments during\nthe calculation.  Some comments are made regarding \nthe reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses or\nlimitations of the disk system.  Several possible \nfuture applications are noted which appear to have disk connotations."

Their principal\njob satisfactions relate to the nature of their \nwork, and mostfind their jobs offer high level of professional\ninterest and good working conditions. \n Salary and advancement prospects, however,are not as\nsatisfactory.  More than half report a positive \nattitude toward programmers and programming on the part\nof their organizations.  Turnover among themselves \nis attributed primarily to poor management-salary is\nseen as the principal motivating factor in turnover \namong other programmers.  Nature of the work offered\nand salary are principal determinants in accepting \na new job.  Programmers are less mobile than expected.\n Programmers tend to see their colleagues in a \nfavorable light, on the whole.  Personalities seem to\nvary with function, systems programmers differing \nfrom applications programmers.  Four principal problems\nfor programming in the immediate future are listed \nby participants: languages, personnel, various specific\napplications and techniques, and building programming \nas a profession."

Transfers\nbetween the core and drum stores and to and from \nthe twin paper-tape input and output channels are all\navailable autonomously (concurrently, time-shared). \n Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous,\nso that the machine may be executing up to three \norders simultaneously.  All functions naturally are interlocked.\n A number of other advanced orders and \nfacilities are also incorporated.In particular, an\n\"Execute\" order permits a temporary jump for up \nto four orders and a second modifier register permits double\nmodification in general and relative addressing \nof subroutines in particular.  Thus the overall effective\nspeed of the machine is muchhigher than its \nbasic specification would lead one to expect and its\ndesign indicates one way in which the concepts of \ntime sharing may be incorporated in \"low-cost\" computers."

Conversely,\na chained file allocation permits efficient \nalteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file\norganized into a tree-like structure is discussed, \nand it is shown that such a file may both be searched\nand altered with times proportional to slog(s)N, \nwhere N is the number of file items and s is a parameter\nof the tree.  It is also shown that optimizing \nthe value of s leads to a search time which is only 25\nper cent slower than the binary search.  The tree \norganization employs two data chains and may be considered\nto be a compromise between the organizations \nfor the binary search and the chained file.  The relation\nof the tree organization to multidimensional \nindexing and to the trie structure is also discussed."

The latter problem\nis discussed in this paper, along with criteria \ndeveloped for determining the optimum order of merge according\nto the various properties of random access \nstorage devices.  Attention is also given to the problem\nof key sorting versus record sorting and the \npossibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system."

  "W": "A common requirement in commercial data processing\nis that the sum of a set of numbers, rounded \nin a generally understood manner, be equal to the sum\nof the numbers rounded individually.  Four rounding \nprocedures are described to accomplish this.  The particular\nprocedure that is appropriate depends upon \nwhether the numbers being accumulated can vary in sign,\nwhether their sum can vary in sign, and whether \nthe last number being summed can be recognized as such prior to its rounding."

  "W": "The possibility of natural language translation\nby means of fixed operations on example translations \nis considered.  The conception of sentence translation\nwhich motivates the work is informally presented, \nand the measurement of physical similarity in pairs of\nstrings is discussed, a notion which plays a central \nrole in the proposed type of translator.  Experimental\nevidence is presented in support of the premise \nupon which this conception is based."
